## Support AEE
If you like to appreciate the efforts of developer to provide AEE free (always available in GitHub release page), non-intrusive and without Ads, please consider supporting the development in some way. Maintaining this project take a lot of time. So, each and every support from the android community will be hugely appreciated.
