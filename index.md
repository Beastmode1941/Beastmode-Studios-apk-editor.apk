## Support AEE
If you like to appreciate the efforts of developer to provide AEE free (always available in GitHub release page), non-intrusive and without Ads, please consider supporting the development in some way. Maintaining this project take a lot of time. So, each and every support from the android community will be hugely appreciated.

Some other ways to support the development includes, but not limited to
1.  Buy AEE from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apk.explorer). It's very cheap, but still capable to support the development.
2.  If you already purchased the AEE, please consider rating or/and reviewing the same in Google Play.
3.  Help me to translate AEE into your local language (or improve existing translations).
4.  Share good words about AEE with others (family, friends, and other enthusiastic android users).
     
### Translations
Please help me to translate this application via [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=QztabxONOp). You may also translate after downloading the original language string available [here](app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).
