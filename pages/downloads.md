<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>AEE offers two different versions of APK's with slightly different capabilities for those who interested, and are</tab1></p>

### Google Play

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Google Play version is named as APK Explorer, which itself describes its purpose and limitations clearly. In order to avoid Google's policy violations, this version doesn't offer APK signing and related features. As a result, this version only offers to view and export/save the contents of an installed APK file. Moreover, please be noted that this version is provided as a paid app, mainly to support the development of this project. If you are not really into APK editing, please consider purchasing this version to support the development of this open-source project.</tab1></p>

### F-Droid/GitHub

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>The F-Droid/GitHub version is named as APK Explorer & Editor, which is in fact the full version of AEE. It offers all the capabilities of this project including APK/app bundle signing, very basic editing on the resources (work in progress), as well as the installation of the exported APK's/app bundles. This version is, and always, remains free.</tab1></p>
